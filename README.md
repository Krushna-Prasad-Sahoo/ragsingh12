 Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working as Data Engineer in Cognizant Technology Solutions.

I have experience in SQL, Python, Pyspark, Azure Cloud, Snowflake and Linux.

I have passed certification exams like DP203, DP900, AZ900.

I have also some knowledge about Front end web development.

I am very curious to learn about Data Science tools and technologies.
